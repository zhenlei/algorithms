'''Find the ordering of tasks from given dependencies
refer to  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-ordering-of-tasks-from-given-dependencies/

There are a total of n tasks you have to pick, labeled from 0 to n-1. Some tasks may have
prerequisites tasks, for example to pick task 0 you have to first finish tasks 1, which is
expressed as a pair: [0, 1]

Given the total number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of tasks you
should pick to finish all tasks.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to
finish all tasks, return an empty array.
